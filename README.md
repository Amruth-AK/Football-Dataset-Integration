🏆 Football Dataset Integration
Integrating Football Manager, Transfermarkt, and FBref into a unified player database using PyDI

This repository contains the full pipeline for integrating multiple football player datasets into a single, consistent, fused knowledge base.
The project uses PyDI (Python Data Integration Framework) to carry out the following key steps:

Schema alignment

Identity resolution

Conflict resolution

Data fusion

Quality evaluation using a manually curated gold-standard dataset

The resulting fused dataset provides high-quality player profiles with resolved attribute conflicts, harmonized metadata, and complete provenance information for full transparency.
